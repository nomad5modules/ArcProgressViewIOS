## Usage

Beside the programmatical creation of the ArcProgressView you can use it inside a Storyboard too. Simply create an `UIView` and set the class and module to `ArcProgressView` inside the `Identity Inspector`.

Once configured as `ArcProgressView` you should be able to set up its attributes in the `Attributes Inspector`

Have fun playing around with combinations of the `Progress Color` and the views `Background Color`.
